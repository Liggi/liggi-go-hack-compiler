# Tokeniser and Parser

This was a bit of a failed experiment. I got overeager and attempted to build something that would simultaneously tokenise and parse the Jack language as part of the NAND to Tetris project. It works, but it's quite hard to read, and would be hard to maintain in the future. Given that, I'm going to separate them out and start over. But I wanted to keep this here as a record of the attempt.
